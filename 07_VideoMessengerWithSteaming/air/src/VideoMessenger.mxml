	recorder
		- add 'connecting' state as it takes a couple of seconds
		- sound not recording either??
		
	player
		- keep a list of messages
		- use streaming?
		
	rails
		- could keep track of recorded message
			when sending recording send a picture to rails,
			rails associates message+picture+flv file
